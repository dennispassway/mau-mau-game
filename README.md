# Mau Mau Game

Mau-Mau is a card game for 2 to 5 players that is popular in Germany, Austria, South Tyrol, the United States, Brazil, Poland, and the Netherlands. Mau-Mau is a member of the larger Crazy Eights or shedding family, to which e.g. the proprietary card games of Uno and Flaps belong. However Mau-Mau is played with standard French or German-suited playing cards.
